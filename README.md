# 📝 AI Journal

AI Journal is a simple journaling web app built with **React + Vite** and styled with **Bootstrap**.  
Users can write about their day, generate a polished journal entry (mock AI), see mood insights,  
and save their entries for later — all in a clean, minimal interface with a soft gradient background.

## ✨ Features

✅ **Generate Polished Entry** – AI (mocked for now) rewrites your notes nicely  
✅ **Mood Insight** – Detects Positive / Neutral / Stressed mood  
✅ **Tip for Tomorrow** – Suggests one simple action to try  
✅ **Save Entries** – Stored locally in the browser (localStorage)  
✅ **View History** – See past journal entries in a card layout  
✅ **Bootstrap Design** – Responsive, modern, and clean
